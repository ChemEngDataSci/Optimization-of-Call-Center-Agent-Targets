# Optimization-of-Call-Center-Agent-Targets
The purpose of this problem is to find the ideal targets and its weightings of a call center agent's scorecard. 
Scorecards are used to track the agent's performance (such as customer quality, save rate, first call resolution, average handle time, 
transfer percentage). &lt;br>  

In this exercise, i used a linear regression to model the relationship between all the different metrics and their 
impacts to average handle time, which is the most important metric and the upper management focuses on this the most. 
Once the model is determined, it is translated into an optimization function to determine for what values of the metrics, 
will yield the lowest average handle time. The lower the average handle time, the better it is in terms of cost savings.
